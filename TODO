GAME TICK:
----------
    - During a game tick, re-lock all unlocked doors.
        - this involves having a separate array for altering locked state
          and copying over the original state into it.
    - Decay corpses over time.
    - Decay temporary magical effects over time.
    - Need to reset area data like room items.

GAMEPLAY:
---------
    - Add sacrifices to the gods.
        - for gold coins or random items.
    - Wear locations need to include layering/stacking of equipment.

NPCs:
------
    - Normal NPCs should share a single file, while some NPCs use their own files.
        - something like loading an NPC by name from a file.
        - or maybe just have a flag in the data structure that indicates if a NPC
          is inserted into the game at runtime.
